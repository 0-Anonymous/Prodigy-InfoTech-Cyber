## About The Project

This project is a collection of five distinct scripts, each tackling a different aspect of cybersecurity. The goal was to build functional tools that showcase foundational skills in data encryption, system monitoring, and network analysis.

## Tasks Completed

1.  **Caesar Cipher**
    - A classic substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts text by shifting letters by a fixed number of positions.

2.  **Image Encryption**
    - A tool to encrypt and decrypt image files using a key-based algorithm, effectively scrambling and restoring pixel data.

3.  **Keylogger**
    - A script that captures and logs keystrokes from the keyboard. This tool is intended for educational purposes to understand system monitoring.

4.  **Password Strength Checker**
    - A utility that assesses the strength of a given password based on criteria such as length, and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

5.  **Packet Sniffer**
    - A network analysis tool that captures and inspects data packets flowing through a specified network interface, providing insights into network traffic.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pillow (PIL)` for Image Encryption
    * `pynput` for the Keylogger
    * `scapy` for the Packet Sniffer
